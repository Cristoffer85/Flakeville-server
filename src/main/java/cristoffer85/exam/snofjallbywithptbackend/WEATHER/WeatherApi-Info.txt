API Location set to Salen, Sweden, Latitude: 13.27 Longitude: 61.16
(which is very close to home and origin-child for me)

Current Weather (from RapidAPI) is from to https://rapidapi.com/joeykyber/api/ski-resort-forecast

5Day Forecast (from OpenWeatherMap) is from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

Had to split the API calls into two different sources since the first choice from RapidAPI wasnt as stable as I first anticipated.
It crashed alot when making to many calls in a short time, so I had to find another source for the 5Day Forecast.
